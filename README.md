# Starting-Github
For starting and learning Github
It said to make a readme, so here it is! 
This is my first time dealing with computer science past the most basic of points. I was always considered the caveman of my group, where my assumed solution was one involving force. Not my actual mindset; just how I came off I guess? A majority of those around me have done some sort of modding, technical editing, or some form of basic game creation, so my lack of experince really shined through. I hope I can meet and surpass them in the field, and it helps I am really enjoying what I have learned so far.
